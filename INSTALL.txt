Editing a file:
1. Make your edits
2. Use "git add <name-of-file>" to have git track the new file or the new edits of a file ("git add --all" will have git track all files in current directory that have been created/edited)
3. Use git commit -m <"message"> to commit the change (you can think of this like "saving the file")
4. Use "git push" to push the changes to the server. If you configured your git directory correctly "git push" should work, if not, you may need to use "git push <URL>" or 'git push --set-upstream "<URL>  master"'


Getting someone's edits:
1. Use "git pull <URL>" to retrieve the current version of all files
