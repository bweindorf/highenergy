Important: 
  UNU.RAN now relies on some aspects of IEEE 754 compliant floating
  point arithmetic. In particular, 1./0. and 0./0. must result in
  INFINITY and NaN (not a number), respectively, and must not cause a
  floating point exception. For almost all modern compting
  architecture this is implemented in hardware. For others there
  should be a special compiler flag to get this feature (e.g. -MIEEE
  on DEC alpha or -mp for the Intel C compiler).


Upgrading UNU.RAN from version 0.9.x or earlier
...............................................

  With UNU.RAN version 1.0.x some of the macro definitions in file
  'src/unuran_config.h' are moved into file 'config.h' and are
  set/controlled by the ./configure script.

  Writting logging information into the logfile must now be enabled
  when running the configure script:

          sh ./configure --enable-logging


Upgrading UNU.RAN from version 0.7.x or earlier
...............................................

  With UNU.RAN version 0.8.x the interface for changing underlying
  distributions and running a reinitialization routine has been 
  simplified. The old routines can be compiled into the library using 
  the following configure flag:

          sh ./configure --enable-deprecated

  Notice: Using these deprecated routines is not supported any more
  and this strong discouraged.

  Wrapper functions for external sources of uniform random numbers
  are now enabled by configure flags and not by macros defined in 
  file 'src/unuran_config.h'.

  The file 'src/unuran_config.h' is not installed any more. 
  It is now only included when the library is compiled.
  It should be removed from the global include path of the compiler.
